Wolfram Cellular Automata
=========================

Simple implementation of Wolfram's 1D Cellular Automata
The system is implemented in Scala and allows to plot the evolution of an automata over time.

For more information on Wolfram's Cellular Automata check, e.g.:
[Rule 30 @ Mathworld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rule30.html) and 
[Rule 30 @ Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30)

The following images were generated by this program:

![Rule 30](/imgs/rule150.png "Rule 150")


Installation
============
The project is built and run using SBT ([Scala Build Tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/))

1. Make sure that you have Scala and SBT installed

2. Checkout the repository to a local directory

3. Compile by calling `sbt compile`

4. Test with `sbt test`

5. Run with `sbt run`

Several command line options are supported.
